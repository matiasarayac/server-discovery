# Server Discovery

This repo contains scripts to do an inventory of a particular server.

With each script you will get:

1. Operational Information
2. Communication and Process ID
3. List of all process at that time

Each folder contains two scripts: run-discovery and script.

If you run the script file you will get the info through the console and if you run the run-discovery file you will get the same output but in a file with the name of {hostname}_{date}_{time}.txt

So far is only availble for Windows Servers.
